# Things to note

There are two errors from this folder. 

The two errors are from the files lib\widgets\send_lunch\navigationwidget.dart 

and lib\widgets\send_lunch\my_team_search.dart .

There is space between the dummy data and the tabbar help identify these errors. 

the text in the dummy data refuses to justify help fix that with the textalign property. 

I am not sure if the custom button widget has been fixed so i left that out.
